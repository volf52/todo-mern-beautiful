-   `touch nodemon.json`
-   Make sure it has these keys: "MONGO_USERNAME", "MONGO_PASSWORD" and "MONGO_DB"
-   PORT is 4000 by default. It can be changed by using an env variable, or PORT key in nodemon.json.

-   For dev, `yarn dev` and `yarn --cwd client start`
-   For prod, `yarn build:all` followed by `yarn start`
